# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > cause version control is awesome and helps keeps our projects in order...

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > to go somehwere new, make a new file

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > a keyword added to a selector that gives a specific special state to an element when selected. 
    :link, :visited, :hover, :active. I think i will use all 4 of these

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > it is how the code knows which rule is to be applied if there are multiple rules assigned to the same element and property but they have different values . I'll use it for apps and websites when I need to have  the same elements change based on a specific value

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > it can make your code be unreliable and hard to maintain due to it scattering the code in the application causing multiple edits within a single web page. It is best to do it right from the beginning to avoid having to clean up your code later

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > 1. External Reference <link>
    > 2. Property of the selector from the external reference i.e., font-size, background color, etc..
    > 3. Value of the property selected i.e., size or color



07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > User confidence - trust in the brand by using a design that gives the user a smooth and seamless journey. 

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > to keep the concept user-focused as well as clarify and define website features. 

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Yes because you can identify and rectify flaws and pain points before wasting money and time. 

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > borders, margin, padding and the content itself
